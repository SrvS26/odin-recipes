        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Treacle tart is a sweet pastry consisting of a buttery shortcrust base and a gooey filling made from treacle (aka golden syrup), breadcrumbs and lemon zest.
            The first mention of a treacle tart recipe dates back to a 19th century cookbook by English author Mary Jewry.  Since that original recipe treacle tart has commonly included the added ingredients of cream and eggs to create a softer, more luxurious filling.  Treacle tart is a quintessential British teatime dessert.</p>
            <p>And for you Harry Potter fans out there, treacle tart also happens to be Harryâ€™s favorite dessert.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <h4>Shortcrust Pastry</h4>
            <li>1 3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons lard, chilled</li>
            <li>1/3 cup ice cold water</li>
            <h4>Treacle Filling</h4>
            <li>1 1/4 cups golden syrup</li>
            <li>Grated zest and juice of one lemon</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups fresh white breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <h4>Shortcrust Pastry</h4>
            <li>Place the flour and salt in a food processor and pulse to blend.  Next add the cold butter and lard. Pulse a few more times until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the water a little at a time, pulsing between additions, until the mixture begins to come together. DO NOT over-mix the dough or the pastry crust will be tough and won't be flaky. </li>
            <li>Form the dough into a ball, flatten into a 1-inch thick disk, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before using. (The shortcrust pastry can be refrigerated for a few days or frozen for up to 3 months)</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Roll out the pastry dough.  I find it easiest to roll it out on to plastic wrap, it makes transferring it to the tart pan easy. Roll the pastry dough out so that there's a little excess around all sides of the tart pan (it will shrink when baked).</li>
            <li>Carefully place the pastry crust into the tart pan and pierce it multiple times with a fork.
                Line the pastry crust with parchment paper and fill it with dried beans or similar.
                Place the tart on the middle shelf of the oven and bake for 10-15 minutes.
                Remove the beans and parchment paper and continue to bake for another 5-10 minutes or until the crust is a very pale golden.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
            <h4>Treacle Filling</h4>
            <li>Place the golden syrup, lemon zest and lemon juice in a medium saucepan.   Heat the syrup until hot and runny and then stir in the breadcrumbs.  Turn off the heat and let the mixture sit for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Lightly beat the egg and cream together with a fork. Pour the egg/cream mixture into the saucepan with the treacle mixture and stir quickly to combine.</li>
            <li>Pour the hot mixture into the tart crust.
                Place the tart on the middle shelf of the oven (still heated at 375 degreesF) and bake for 20-25 minutes or until the pastry is golden and the filling is nicely browned.
                Remove the tart from the oven and let it cool.</li>
        </ol>
