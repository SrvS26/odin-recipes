        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Butterbeer was served cold in bottles and hot in "foaming tankards".[3] In Hogsmeade, it's sold at the Three Broomsticks Inn[4] and the Hog's Head Inn,[5] although the fact that the latter pub's stock was described as "very dusty" suggested that it was not sold there very often. In Diagon Alley, the drink had been known to be sold at the Leaky Cauldron. It was made out of butterscotch, sugar and water.
        </p>
        <p>At the Hog's Head, customers were charged two sickles per Butterbeer (Â£0.60 approximately),[5] but it was not certain whether this was a universal price for the drink, or if the price of the drink varied from location to location.</p>
