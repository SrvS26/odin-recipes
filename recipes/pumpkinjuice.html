        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pumpkin juice is a deliciously cool and refreshing beverage made with pureed pumpkin, apple juice or apple cider, apricot or peach nectar, warm spices like cinnamon and nutmeg, and a little sugar for sweetness. It’s popularity is largely thanks to the Harry Potter books where it’s mentioned often as a favorite wizarding beverage, but you are unlikely to ever find it in any grocery stores.
        </p>
        <p>In the Harry Potter books, pumpkin juice is mentioned in all but the first book in the series as one of the most popular wizarding beverages (the other being butterbeer, of course). It is served in the Great Hall at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and on the Hogwarts Express snack trolley. This is one magical treat that you are going to love!</p>
